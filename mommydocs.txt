Da main loop:

  In discordClient
    message received:
      build req object (contains information about the message, client it comes from etc)
        send req to agentHub for interpretation

  In agentHub
    loop through each agent for that event type (in this case, receiving a message)
      If a matching agent is found,
        the matching agent will determine which action to run and which params to send to actionHub

  In actionHub
    run the action specified by the agent
      calls the initial callback in the discord client
